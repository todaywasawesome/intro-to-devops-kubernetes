Checkout our project repo first

`git clone https://github.com/todaywasawesome/color-coded/`

This includes our Go app that we'll be building.

`cd color-coded`

We're going to build a Dockerfile from scratch so let's delete the one already here.

`rm Dockerfile && touch Dockerfile`

Use the editor above to start adding code.
