#Setup Codefresh

Before we do anything, goto Github and fork the project repo https://github.com/todaywasawesome/color-coded. Click "Fork" in the top right and follow the prompts to make a copy of the project in your own Github account. 

Then, create your Codefresh account, by going to https://codefresh.io I recommend logging in using Github as this will setup permissions automatically so we can make webhooks and build our code later. 

*If you login with another method, you'll need to add Github as a repo in your Codefresh account settings.*
